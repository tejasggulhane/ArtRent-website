  <p>Realism</p>

    <figcaption>
      Realism is a painting art style that aims to give the viewer a reflection of the real world. Many of the most
      famous paintings are painted in this style and for many, paintings made in this style are what they will think of
      when they think of ‘art’. It is important, however, to make the distinction between realism and photorealism – the
      former concerns itself with a realistic scene but does not aim to be a true depiction

  <p>Photorealism</p>
  <figure>
    <img class="imr" src="/images/p2.jpg" alt="Image Description">
    <figcaption>
      You may also see photorealism referred to as hyperrealism or super-realism. This painting style aims to create a
      painting that’s indistinguishable from real life or a photograph – hence the name. This makes it distinct from
      realism, as unless you take a much closer look at a photorealism painting you will not be able to see that it is
      indeed a painting.

  <p>Expressionism</p>
  <figure>
    <img class="imr" src="/images/p3.jpg" alt="Image Description">
    <figcaption>
      At the other end of the spectrum is expressionism. Expressionism is a style of art that doesn’t concern itself
      with realism, images and scenes are often distorted or painted with otherworldly, vivid colours that don’t match
      up with reality. The focus is instead on the artist’s ideas or feelings, which are expressed through the medium of
      art

  <p>Impressionism</p>
  <figure>
    <img class="imr" src="/images/p4.jpg" alt="Image Description">
    <figcaption>
      Impressionism is a painting style most commonly associated with the 19th century where small brush strokes are
      used to build up a larger picture. This art style lies somewhere between expressionism and realism, with a focus
      on accurate lighting but with no emphasis on a realistic scene.

  <p>Abstract</p>
  <figure>
    <img class="imr" src="/images/p5.jpg" alt="Image Description">
    <figcaption>
      Abstract paintings eschew realism altogether. Whatever the subject in the painting, it may not be accurately
      represented at all in the artwork. Objects may be represented by a colour or a shape instead, with the
      interpretation left up to the viewer. The impact of an abstract painting cannot be understated, with many using
      shocking displays of colour and form to dizzy the senses.

  <p>Surrealism</p>
  <figure>
    <img class="imr" src="/images/p6.jpg" alt="Image Description">
    <figcaption>
      Surrealism first became a movement in the 20th century, with artists such as Salvador Dali becoming household
      names. Combining abstract concepts with semi-realistic objects that have been twisted or morphed into something
      unusual, they can be illogical or dreamlike, giving the viewer a heightened sense of reality.

  <p>Pop Art</p>
  <figure>
    <img class="imr" src="/images/p7.jpg" alt="Image Description">
    <figcaption>
      In the 1950s and onwards, pop art became a movement that drew inspiration from the commodification and
      commercialism of modern life. Using cartoons or adverts in many of the style’s most famous works, pop art uses
      realistic imagery combined with bold colours to highlight the artist’s intent.
